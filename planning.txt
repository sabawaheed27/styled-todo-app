Project Planning: StyledTodo
 Goal:
        Build a responsive Todo App using React + TypeScript + Styled Components with localStorage support.

Functional Requirements:
            -Add new todo
            -Edit existing todo
            -Delete todo
            -Mark as complete/incomplete
            -Toggle between viewing active and completed tasks
            -Persist todos using localStorage
            -Responsive styling using styled-components

Styling Requirements:
            -Use props in styled components
            -Use `createGlobalStyle` for base resets and font styles
            -Use media queries for responsive layout

Components:
            TodoInput:
                Input field + Add button
            TodoItem: 
                Individual todo with edit, delete, toggle
            App: 
                Main stateful component managing todos

Type Definitions:
             Create `Todo` type with `text` and `completed` fields

Data Persistence:
            On load: 
                Read from localStorage
            On update: 
                Write to localStorage

File Organization:
            /src/components – UI components
            /src/styles – Global and shared styles
            /src/types – Reusable types/interfaces
            App.tsx – Main app logic
            index.tsx – App entry point
