Project Planning: StyledTodo
 Goal:
        Build a responsive Todo App using React + TypeScript + Styled Components with localStorage support.

Functional Requirements:
            -Add new todo
            -Edit existing todo
            -Delete todo
            -Mark as complete/incomplete
            -Toggle between viewing active and completed tasks
            -Persist todos using localStorage

Styling Requirements:
            -Use props in styled components
            -Use `Globals.css` for html and body
            

Components:
            Input:
            TodoItem: 
            TodoList:
            Header:
            Footer:
            Button:
            

Data Persistence:
            On load: 
                Read from localStorage
            On update: 
                Write to localStorage

File Organization:
            /src/components – UI components
            /src/styles – Global and shared styles
